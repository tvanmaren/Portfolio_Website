# My Portfolio Website

## Technologies
- jQuery, Bootstrap, Bootstrap Validator, and lots and lots of custom CSS.

## APIs
- Email integration provided by [Formspree](https://formspree.io).

## Customized and refined from [Start Bootstrap's](http://startbootstrap.com/) [Stylish Portfolio](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/stylish-portfolio/)
- I keep the basic Stylish Portfolio UI design (if it ain't broke, don't fix it).
- My Menu & Google Maps integration are customized from Stylish Portfolio defaults.
- My Projects Filter & Contact Form are custom built with Bootstrap, jQuery, and CSS.

## Ongoing Development
- It's about time to refactor this into an AngularJS SPA--which I'll be working on when I have some time.
